GDB - The GNU Debugger

	
		The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see what is going on
       "inside" another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing
       at the moment it crashed.

       GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of these) to
       help you catch bugs in the act:

       路   Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.

       路   Make your program stop on specified conditions.

       路   Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.

       路   Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the
           effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.

	-> make your executable as Debug_Enable
	use -g flag with
	g++ -g demo.c
	
	-> use the following commands for debugging

	l			(line)
	b <linenumber>		(breakpoint)
	r			(run)
	p			(to know the value of perticular variable)
	n			(next)
	q			(quit)
